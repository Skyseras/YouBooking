# YouBooking
Hotel Booking System with Spring boot + Angular

YouBooking™ is a web application allowing users to book accommodation online.

Being a full stack developer, Your solution must automate the reservation process by providing a single-page web application.

The first step is described as follows:

o Customers can view listings of available hotels and rooms. o Filter rooms by hotel name, availability date and city. o Make a reservation. o Consult the list of his reservations, modify or cancel a reservation.

The application that you are required to develop must also allow hotel owners to:

o Insert all the hotels as well as the rooms they wish to be reserved by customers. o Manage the availability of rooms and hotels. o Confirm customer reservations.

YouBooking™ must therefore include a space for its administrators so that they can have full control:

o Manage the complete list of hotels. o Manage users (add, modify, ban). o Accept/refuse hotel ads (add by owner).



You are led today to discover the Angular Framework, while respecting the following standards:

Create a work plan for the app with the different tasks using JIRA or trello. Perform system analysis using UML. Create the database using MySQL || PostgreSql Create the different APIs using the Spring Boot Framework Secure your APIs via Spring security while respecting the different roles (Client, owner, Admin) Consumption of APIs via Angular and Establish a functional and responsive single-page application
